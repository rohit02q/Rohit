  <p style="color:hsl(224, 56%, 12%)">Hi, Iâ€™m Rohit!

Iâ€™m a student currently preparing for my 10th board exams. I come from Jafrapatti, a small but beautiful village in Vaishali district, Bihar. Growing up here has taught me the value of hard work and simplicity, which I carry with me in everything I do.

As a 10th grader, I take my education seriously because I believe itâ€™s the key to a bright future. My favorite subject is Mathematics, and Iâ€™m proud of my progress so farâ€”I scored 98 marks in my pre-board exams, which motivates me to keep pushing myself. I enjoy solving challenging problems and understanding concepts deeply, not just for exams but because I genuinely love learning.

Apart from studies, Iâ€™ve recently developed an interest in technology and programming. Python, in particular, fascinates me because of how it can be used to create practical solutions for real-world problems. While Iâ€™m still learning, Iâ€™m excited to explore this field more in the future and maybe even make a career out of it.

I would describe myself as someone who is determined and focused. I set goals for myself and work hard to achieve them, but I also try to keep a balance in life. When Iâ€™m not studying, I enjoy spending time thinking creatively, writing, or exploring new ideas that inspire me.

This portfolio is a reflection of who I amâ€”someone who is constantly learning, growing, and dreaming big. Itâ€™s a small step towards the future I hope to build, and Iâ€™m excited to share my journey with you. Thank you for visiting!</p>
